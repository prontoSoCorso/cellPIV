CLINICAL INTERPRETATION GUIDE (NOT_VITAL MERGING, 1 DAYS)

1. Overall Performance:
- Best balanced accuracy: 0.65 (ConvTran)
- Best F1 score: 0.63 (ROCKET)

2. Key Findings:
- Non-viable detection: ConvTran (BA=0.95) > ROCKET (BA=0.94) > LSTMFCN (BA=0.91)
- 2.1PN reliability: All models show strong performance (BA=0.88, F1=0.86)
- 3PN challenges: ConvTran has lowest BA=0.59 (manual review recommended)

3. Model Comparison:
- ConvTran: Best for 1PN (BA=0.63) and non-viables
- ROCKET: Most consistent in >3PN (F1=0.5)
- LSTMFCN: Avoid for 3PN (BA=0.66, F1=0.57)

4. Critical Observations:
- 1.1PN F1=0.0 across all models - requires embryologist review
- 2PN performance varies significantly (BA 0.55-0.58)

5. Clinical Recommendations:
- Use ConvTran for initial non-viable screening
- Manual verification required for:
  - All 1.1PN cases
  - ConvTran 3PN predictions
  - LSTMFCN >3PN assessments

Note: F1 Score <0.4 indicates high uncertainty, >0.7 indicates clinical reliability
