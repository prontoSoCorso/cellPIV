CLINICAL INTERPRETATION GUIDE (ANOMALOUS MERGING, 3 DAYS)

    1. Overall Performance:
    - Best balanced accuracy: 0.76 (ConvTran)
    - Best F1 score: 0.74 (ROCKET)

    2. Model Comparison:
    - ConvTran excels in detecting rare anomalies (3PN/>3PN: BA=1.00)
    - ROCKET shows robust performance in common cases (2PN: F1=0.75)
    - LSTMFCN provides balanced performance across categories

    3. Key Clinical Insights:
    - Non-viable embryos (0PN/deg) are perfectly identified (BA=1.00)
    - 1.1PN cases show high variability (F1=0.00) - manual review recommended
    - 3PN detection reliability: ConvTran (F1=0.84) > ROCKET (F1=0.67)

    4. Actionable Recommendations:
    - Use ConvTran for anomaly screening
    - Use ROCKET for routine 2PN assessment
    - Always verify 1.1PN/2.1PN cases manually
    - Trust model predictions for non-viable embryos (100% accuracy)

    Note: F1 Score <0.4 indicates high uncertainty, >0.7 indicates clinical reliability
